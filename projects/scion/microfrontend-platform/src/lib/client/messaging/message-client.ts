/**
 * Message client for sending and receiving messages between applications across origins.
 *
 * This client allows intent-based and topic-based messaging, and supports wildcard addressing, request-response message exchange pattern,
 * retained messaging, and more.
 *
 * #### Intent-based messaging
 * Intent-based messaging allows sending an intent to clients that provide a fulfilling capability. Sending an intent requires the sending app to declare
 * an intention in its manifest and some application to provide a capability.
 *
 * Intents, intentions and capabilities are formulated in an abstract way having a type and an optional qualifier. The type allows the categorization
 * of the functionality, and the qualifier describes the functionality in more detail. The qualifier has the form of a dictionary.
 *
 * When issuing an intent, the qualifier must be exact, thus not contain wildcards. When subscribing to intents, the platform routes all intents,
 * for which this app provides a satisfying capability, to this client. The subscriber can pass a selector to filter received intents.
 *
 * #### Topic-based messaging
 * Represents the `publishâ€“subscribe` messaging pattern to publish a message to multiple consumers subscribed to a topic.
 *
 * Topics are case-sensitive and consist of one or more segments, each separated by a forward slash. When publishing a message to a topic,
 * the topic must be exact, thus not contain wildcards. A subscriber can subscribe to multiple topics simultaneously by using the colon
 * syntax; that is, if a topic segment begins with a colon (`:`), then the segment acts as a placeholder for any value. For example, subscribing to
 * the topic `person/:id` receives messages published to the topics `person/5` and `person/6`. Substituted segment values are available in
 * the params map on the received message.
 *
 * Messages published to a topic can be marked as 'retained'. Retained messages help newly-subscribed clients to get the last message published to
 * a topic. The broker stores one retained message per topic. To delete a retained message, send a retained message without a body to the topic -
 * deletion messages are not transported to subscribers.
 *
 * #### Messaging headers
 * The platform allows adding custom headers to an intent or topic message, which then can be read by the receiver. A header can contain any
 * data that is serializable with the structured clone algorithm.
 *
 * #### Request-Response message exchange pattern
 * Both messaging types support the request-response message exchange pattern, allowing a receiver to reply to a request. Just as in JMS
 * (Java Message Service), the platform sets a {@link MessageHeaders.ReplyTo ReplyTo} header on the message. The recipient of a request then
 * sends the response(s) to this topic. If streaming data, the replier can use the {@link takeUntilUnsubscribe} operator to stop replying when
 * the requestor unsubscribes.
