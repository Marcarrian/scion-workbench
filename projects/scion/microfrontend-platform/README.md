SCION Microfrontend Platform
============================

SCION Microfrontend Platform provides the building blocks for integrating microfrontends based on iframes.

It is a pure TypeScript framework allowing to integrate any web content. It comes with a powerful messaging facility for
cross-origin intent- or topic-based communication supporting wildcard addressing, request-response message exchange pattern,
retained messaging and more. Web content is embedded using a responsive web component which encapsulates the iframe.
The component solves many of the cumbersome quirks of iframes and sets up a context in which data can be made available
to the embedded content.
